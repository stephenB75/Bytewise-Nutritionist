# Production Debug Status

## Current Investigation
Checking why production app still shows "Configuration Required" despite fixes.

## Server Status
- Production build created: 623KB bundle
- Server attempting to start on port 8080
- Need to verify actual authentication configuration in production bundle

## Issue Tracking
The production JavaScript bundle may not contain the `isConfigured: true` fix.
Need to:
1. Verify production server is accessible
2. Check if authentication configuration is properly embedded
3. Identify what's causing "Configuration Required" in production

## Next Steps
- Start working production server
- Verify authentication configuration in production bundle
- Apply fix directly to production if needed
- Test authentication flow in production environment
