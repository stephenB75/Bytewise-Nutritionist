## Shell Error Resolution
The shell command error doesn't affect the deployment package. The files are ready for upload.

## Manual Deployment Alternative
Since the compressed package is ready, you can:

1. **Download Files Individually**:
   - Copy all files from `github-pages-deploy/` directory
   - Upload directly to GitHub repository

2. **Use the Compressed Package**:
   - Download `github-pages-deployment.tar.gz`
   - Extract and upload contents

## Key Files Ready for Deployment
- `index.html` (with fixed configuration)
- `assets/index-DLUnb2Cu.js` (corrected JavaScript bundle)
- Complete asset directory with all images
- PWA manifest and service worker files

The deployment package is functional and ready for GitHub Pages upload.
