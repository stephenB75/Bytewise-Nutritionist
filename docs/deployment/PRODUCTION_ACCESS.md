# Production Access via GitHub Pages

## Direct Access to Your Live Site
Your production ByteWise app is accessible at:
**https://stephtonybro.github.io/Bytewise-Nutritionist/**

## Current Status
- GitHub Pages site is live and accessible
- Configuration fix needs to be deployed
- Updated files are ready in `github-pages-deploy/`

## To Apply the Fix
1. Upload contents of `github-pages-deploy/` to your GitHub repository
2. The fix will automatically deploy to your live site
3. You can then access the working app directly via the GitHub Pages URL

## Test Access
You can test your production site directly from any browser by visiting:
https://stephtonybro.github.io/Bytewise-Nutritionist/

This bypasses any local server issues and gives you direct access to your live production deployment.
