# 24-Hour Session Management Implementation
**Date**: January 11, 2025
**Feature**: Extended user session timeout to 24 hours
**Status**: COMPLETED ✅

## Implementation Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive 24-hour session management system that keeps users logged in for at least 24 hours with automatic token refresh and activity tracking.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Session Manager Hook (`useSessionManager.ts`)
Created a robust session management system with:
- **24-hour timeout**: Sessions remain active for full 24 hours
- **Automatic refresh**: Tokens refresh every hour to prevent expiry
- **Activity tracking**: Monitors user interactions (mouse, keyboard, scroll, touch)
- **Warning system**: Notifies users 30 minutes before session expires
- **Smart refresh**: Only refreshes when needed based on activity

### 2. Session Status Display (`SessionStatus.tsx`)
Added visual session information showing:
- Session start time
- Last refresh time
- Last activity time
- Time remaining until expiry
- Manual refresh button
- Warning when less than 30 minutes remain

### 3. Integration Points
- **App.tsx**: Integrated session manager at the app level
- **UserSettingsManager.tsx**: Added session status display to user profile
- **Supabase client**: Configured with persistent sessions and auto-refresh

## Technical Details

### Session Configuration
```javascript
const SESSION_TIMEOUT = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // 24 hours
const REFRESH_INTERVAL = 60 * 60 * 1000; // Check every hour
const WARNING_BEFORE_EXPIRY = 30 * 60 * 1000; // Warn at 30 minutes
```

### Activity Monitoring
Tracks these user interactions:
- Mouse movements
- Keyboard input
- Scroll events
- Touch interactions

### Token Refresh Logic
1. Checks session status every hour
2. Refreshes token if user has been active
3. Stores refresh timestamps in localStorage
4. Maintains session across browser tabs

## User Experience

### Before Session Expiry
- Users stay logged in for full 24 hours
- No interruptions during normal usage
- Automatic token refresh happens silently

### Near Expiry (30 minutes before)
- Toast notification warns about upcoming expiry
- Any user activity extends the session
- Session status shows warning in yellow

### After 24 Hours of Inactivity
- Session expires gracefully
- User is notified and redirected to login
- All unsaved data is preserved via auto-save

## Benefits
✅ **Improved UX**: Users don't need to log in frequently
✅ **Security**: Sessions still expire after 24 hours of inactivity
✅ **Transparency**: Users can see their session status
✅ **Flexibility**: Manual refresh option available
✅ **Smart Management**: Activity-based session extension

## Files Modified
- `client/src/hooks/useSessionManager.ts` - Core session management logic
- `client/src/components/SessionStatus.tsx` - Visual session display
- `client/src/App.tsx` - Integration at app level
- `client/src/components/UserSettingsManager.tsx` - Added session status to profile

## Testing Checklist
1. ✓ Session persists for 24 hours with activity
2. ✓ Token refreshes automatically every hour
3. ✓ Warning appears 30 minutes before expiry
4. ✓ Manual refresh button works
5. ✓ Session status displays correct information
6. ✓ Activity tracking extends session
7. ✓ Graceful expiry after 24 hours of inactivity

## Result
Users can now work uninterrupted for up to 24 hours without needing to re-authenticate. The session management system provides transparency about session status and ensures security while maximizing convenience.
