# Fasting Timer & Micronutrient Display Fix Report

## Date: August 11, 2025

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Fasting Timer Persistence
**Problem:** Fasting timer was not persisting when the app was refreshed or closed.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added localStorage persistence for fasting sessions with keys:
  - `fastingSession`: Stores the complete session data
  - `fastingActive`: Stores the active state
- Implemented server synchronization with `/api/fasting/active` endpoint
- Added recovery mechanism that syncs with server if localStorage is empty
- Timer now calculates remaining time based on actual elapsed time, not just countdown

**Key Changes:**
- `FastingTracker.tsx`: Added `useQuery` for active session from server
- Added `useEffect` to sync server session with localStorage on mount
- Invalidates both history and active queries on session start/complete

### 2. Micronutrient Cards Display
**Problem:** Micronutrient cards were showing placeholder data instead of actual values from logged meals.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Enhanced `calculateMicronutrients` function in `ModernFoodLayout.tsx`
- Function now:
  1. First tries to aggregate real micronutrient data from meals
  2. Checks if any micronutrient value > 0 (indicating real data)
  3. Returns actual values if available, falls back to estimates if not
- Added debug logging to trace micronutrient data flow
- Ensured micronutrient data is saved with meals in `CalorieCalculator.tsx`

**Key Changes:**
- Micronutrient data is stored in localStorage with each meal
- Data includes: vitaminC, vitaminD, vitaminB12, folate, iron, calcium, zinc, magnesium
- Values are calculated and displayed in real-time as meals are logged

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Fasting Timer Persistence
1. **Start a fasting session:**
   - Go to the Tracking tab
   - Select a fasting plan (e.g., 16:8)
   - Click "Start Fasting"
   - Note the timer value

2. **Test refresh persistence:**
   - Refresh the browser (F5 or Cmd+R)
   - Navigate back to Tracking tab
   - Verify timer continues from where it left off

3. **Test app close/reopen:**
   - Close the browser tab completely
   - Reopen the app
   - Navigate to Tracking tab
   - Verify timer is still running with correct time

4. **Test cross-device sync (if logged in):**
   - Timer should sync via server if user is authenticated
   - Active session retrieved from `/api/fasting/active`

### Test 2: Micronutrient Display
1. **Log a meal with micronutrients:**
   - Go to USDA Calculator tab
   - Enter an ingredient (e.g., "spinach")
   - Enter measurement (e.g., "2 cups")
   - Click Calculate
   - Log the meal to a category

2. **Verify micronutrient display:**
   - Go to Home/Nutrition tab
   - Check the "Essential Micronutrients" section
   - Values should reflect the logged meal's nutrients
   - Check browser console for debug logs showing:
     - "Today meals with micronutrients"
     - "Calculated micronutrients"

3. **Test accumulation:**
   - Log another meal
   - Verify micronutrient values increase appropriately
   - Values should be sum of all today's meals

## Expected Behavior

### Fasting Timer
- Timer persists across:
  - Page refreshes
  - Browser restarts
  - Tab closes/reopens
- Time remaining calculated from actual start time
- Syncs with server when online
- Works offline with localStorage

### Micronutrient Cards
- Display actual values from logged meals
- Show 0 when no meals logged
- Update immediately when meals are added
- Persist in localStorage
- 8 micronutrients tracked:
  - Vitamin C (mg)
  - Vitamin D (μg)
  - Vitamin B12 (μg)
  - Folate (μg)
  - Iron (mg)
  - Calcium (mg)
  - Zinc (mg)
  - Magnesium (mg)

## Technical Details

### Data Flow - Fasting
1. User starts fast → Saved to localStorage immediately
2. API call to create server session → Updates with session ID
3. On refresh → Loads from localStorage first
4. If no localStorage → Queries server for active session
5. Timer runs based on actual elapsed time calculation

### Data Flow - Micronutrients
1. User logs meal in CalorieCalculator
2. Micronutrient data saved to localStorage with meal
3. ModernFoodLayout loads meals from localStorage
4. calculateMicronutrients aggregates values
5. MicronutrientCard components display actual values

## Verification Status
- [x] Fasting timer localStorage implementation
- [x] Fasting timer server sync
- [x] Micronutrient data storage
- [x] Micronutrient calculation function
- [x] Micronutrient display components
- [x] Debug logging added

## Notes
- Both features use localStorage for offline functionality
- Server sync provides backup and cross-device support
- Micronutrient estimation fallback ensures graceful degradation
- All changes maintain backward compatibility
