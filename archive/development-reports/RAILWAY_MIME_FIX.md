# Railway Deployment MIME Type Fix

## Issue
The production deployment at bytewisenutritionist.com was serving CSS and JavaScript files with incorrect MIME type (`text/html` instead of `text/css` and `application/javascript`), causing the browser to refuse to load them.

## Root Cause
The Express server in production looks for static files in `server/public` directory, but the Vite build process outputs files to `client/dist`. This mismatch caused the server to serve the default HTML fallback for all static asset requests.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Dockerfile
Added a step to copy the built client files to the correct location:
```dockerfile
# Build the application
RUN npm run build

# Copy built client files to server/public for production serving
RUN mkdir -p server/public && cp -r client/dist/* server/public/
```

### 2. Redundant File Copying
The Dockerfile now ensures files are in both locations:
- `client/dist` - Original build output
- `server/public` - Where the production server expects them

### 3. Created Post-Build Script
Added `postbuild.js` to handle file copying programmatically if needed locally.

### 4. Updated Deployment Script
Modified `deploy-railway.sh` to include the file copy step for local testing.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Rebuild and deploy using Docker:**
```bash
railway up
```

Or if using the deployment script:
```bash
chmod +x deploy-railway.sh
./deploy-railway.sh
```

2. **Verify the deployment:**
- Check that static assets load correctly at https://www.bytewisenutritionist.com
- Inspect Network tab to ensure CSS/JS files have correct Content-Type headers
- Verify the health check at https://www.bytewisenutritionist.com/api/health

## Testing Locally
To test the production build locally:
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Copy files to server/public
mkdir -p server/public
cp -r client/dist/* server/public/

# Start in production mode
NODE_ENV=production npm start
```

## Prevention
For future deployments, always ensure:
1. The Dockerfile includes the file copy step
2. The build process outputs are in sync with server expectations
3. Test production builds locally before deploying

## Status
✅ Fix implemented and ready for deployment
✅ Health check endpoint simplified for reliability
✅ Deployment documentation updated
